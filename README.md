# LEGO-Porsche-Controller
Python tool made to control LEGO Porsche 42176 with XBox Controller and PC

For now, it supports:
- reading joystick input with pygame
- connecting to LEGO's new Technic Move hub introduced in set 42176 with bleak
- reading and writing Bluetooth Low Energy data to vehicle
- reading battery level, HW and FW version
- driving forward and backwards using XBox Controller

I'm currently working on:
- steering funcionality
- 6LED funcionality
- stall protection
